# Gravity Bloom

**Team Members:** Samarth Guptha  (Slack Member ID: U06SJ8RGGK1)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like *Celeste* meets *Portal* but with gravity-flipping puzzles and environmental renewal as the core theme."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- **Gravity Flipping:** Players can reverse gravity at will, flipping the entire environment upside down. This allows for creative platforming, solving spatial puzzles, and navigating through otherwise inaccessible areas.
- **Environmental Transformation:** Activating Seeds of Light causes platforms to grow, debris to move, and the barren world to come alive, creating dynamic changes in the environment.
- **Physics-Driven Challenges:** Falling debris and shifting hazards respond to gravity changes, adding a layer of unpredictability and strategy.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. **Explore:** Navigate a barren, decayed 2D sidescroller world by jumping, flipping gravity, and interacting with environmental objects.
2. **Solve Puzzles:** Use gravity flipping to move debris, avoid hazards, and reach Seeds of Light.
3. **Activate Seeds:** Trigger environmental growth to unlock new platforms, paths, and puzzle solutions.
4. **Progress:** Advance to new areas by solving increasingly challenging puzzles while uncovering visual cues about the story.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- **Puzzle Variety:** Each stage introduces new challenges, such as moving platforms, timed hazards, and puzzles requiring precise gravity flips.
- **Layered Mechanics:** Later levels combine mechanics (e.g., flipping gravity while timing jumps to catch falling platforms).
- **Visual and Narrative Progression:** The decayed world transforms into a lush, vibrant environment as players activate Seeds, giving a sense of achievement and progression.
- **Replayability:** Hidden paths and optional Seeds encourage exploration for those who want to 100% complete the game :D
